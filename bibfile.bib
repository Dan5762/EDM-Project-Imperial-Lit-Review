 abstract = {Abstract  We use two-dimensional transverse laser cooling to produce an ultracold beam of YbF molecules. Through experiments and numerical simulations, we study how the cooling is influenced by the polarization configuration, laser intensity, laser detuning and applied magnetic field. The ultracold part of the beam contains more than 2 × 10 5 molecules per shot and has a temperature below 200 μ K, and the cooling yields a 300-fold increase in the brightness of the beam. The method can improve the precision of experiments that use molecules to test fundamental physics. In particular, the beam is suitable for measuring the electron electric dipole moment with a statistical precision better than 10 −30 e cm. },

	abstract = {Measurements of the electron’s electric dipole moment (eEDM) are demanding tests of physics beyond the standard model. We describe how ultracold YbF molecules could be used to improve the precision of eEDM measurements by two to three orders of magnitude. Using numerical simulations, we show how the combination of magnetic focussing, two-dimensional transverse laser cooling, and frequency-chirped laser slowing, can produce an intense, slow, highly-collimated molecular beam. We show how to make a magneto-optical trap of YbF molecules and how the molecules could be loaded into an optical lattice. eEDM measurements could be made using the slow molecular beam or using molecules trapped in the lattice. We estimate the statistical sensitivity that could be reached in each case and consider how sources of noise can be reduced so that the shot-noise limit of sensitivity can be reached. We also consider systematic effects due to magnetic fields and vector light shifts and how they could be controlled.}

abstract = {We report on the first observation of time-reversal symmetry violation through a comparison of the probabilities of K0 transforming into K0 and K0 into K0 as a function of the neutral-kaon eigentime t. The comparison is based on the analysis of the neutral-kaon semileptonic decays recorded in the CPLEAR experiment. There, the strangeness of the neutral kaon at time t=0 was tagged by the kaon charge in the reaction pp→K±π∓K0(K0) at rest, whereas the strangeness of the kaon at the decay time t=τ was tagged by the lepton charge in the final state. An average decay-rate asymmetry〈R(K0t=0→e+π−νt=τ)−R(K0t=0→e−π+νt=τ)R(K0t=0→e+π−νt=τ)+R(K0t=0→e−π+νt=τ)〉=(6.6±1.3stat±1.0syst)×10−3was measured over the interval 1τS<τ<20τS, thus leading to evidence for time-reversal non-invariance.}

Here, we give a more detailed description of the methods used to make this measurement, along with a fuller analysis of the data. We show how our methods isolate the electric dipole moment from imperfections in the experiment that might mimic it. We describe the systematic errors that we discovered, and the small corrections that we made to account for these. By making a set of additional measurements with greatly exaggerated experimental imperfections, we find upper bounds on possible uncorrected systematic errors which we use to determine the systematic uncertainty in the measurement. We also calculate the size of some systematic effects that have been important in previous electric dipole moment measurements, such as the motional magnetic field effect and the geometric phase, and show them to be negligibly small in the present experiment. Our result is consistent with an electric dipole moment of zero, so we provide upper bounds to its size at various confidence levels. Finally, we review the prospects for future improvements in the precision of the experiment.}

abstract={Results are given from the next-generation search for T-violation in 205Tl, which is interpreted in terms of an electric dipole moment of the electron (de) using theory. The new experiment is a major upgrade of the apparatus used to set the previous best limit on de. Like its predecessor, it uses magnetic resonance with separated oscillating fields, laser optical pumping for state selection and analysis, and counter-propagating vertical atomic beams to control systematic effects arising from motional magnetic fields E × v/c. New to this incarnation are side-by-side atomic beam regions with common magnetic but opposite electric fields, and the addition of 23Na, with concomitant measurement equipment, to the atomic beams. The neighboring atomic beams provide common-mode noise rejection and an additional handle on some systematics. Simultaneous study of the sodium provides another handle, since it is insensitive to d e but susceptible to the same magnetic effects as thallium. Furthermore, sodium's two useful ground state hyperfine levels allow the separation of the two different types of motional field effects. The new result is d e = (6.8 ± 8.1) × 10−28 e cm. A detailed discussion of the experimental method is given. Several ancillary discoveries are also described, including a new kind of motional field systematic and a novel method for studying leakage/charging current effects, a general problem for experiments of this type.},
